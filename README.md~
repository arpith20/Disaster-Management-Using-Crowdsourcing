Disaster Management Using Crowdsourcing
=======================================

Project Description
-----------
Crowdsourcing is a method of information collection which utilizes data received from volunteers.
A recent approach to its use is in the production of volunteer-produced information before, 
during and after a disaster takes place. This approach is inherently in 
line with the requirements of disaster preparedness and recovery.  

During a disaster, information is at a premium: there is an urgent need to know which 
areas are affected, how they are affected, what the priority problems are and so forth. 
This typically coincides with the disruption of traditional lines of communication. The 
advent of modern connected devices, such as mobile phones, has provided a new digital 
development infrastructure, which may be of significant value to disaster response.
When existing surveillance sensors used by a disaster warning and response system cannot 
provide adequate data for situation assessment purposes, crowdsourcing information 
collection can be an effective solution: People armed with wireless devices and social 
network services can be used as mobile human sensors. Eye-witness reports from them 
can complement data from in-situ physical sensors and provide the system with more 
extensive and detailed sensor coverage.  

The crowdsourcing strategy used by the system can be random, relying solely on 
mobility of individuals for coverage of the threatened area, or crowd driven, with the 
system providing situation updates as feedbacks to aid the crowd; or system-driven 
with individuals moving in response to directives from the system. With such a system, 
emergency management professionals can also receive most of the information they need 
for preparing themselves to perform a timely and accurate treatment of their patients 
even before dispatching a response team to the event.
