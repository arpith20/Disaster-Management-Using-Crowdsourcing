{"name":"Disaster Management Using Crowdsourcing","tagline":"Final Year Project (Under Construction!)","body":"Disaster Management Using Crowdsourcing\r\n=======================================\r\n\r\nProject Description\r\n-----------\r\nCrowdsourcing is a method of information collection which utilizes data received from volunteers.\r\nA recent approach to its use is in the production of volunteer-produced information before, \r\nduring and after a disaster takes place. This approach is inherently in \r\nline with the requirements of disaster preparedness and recovery.  \r\n\r\nDuring a disaster, information is at a premium: there is an urgent need to know which \r\nareas are affected, how they are affected, what the priority problems are and so forth. \r\nThis typically coincides with the disruption of traditional lines of communication. The \r\nadvent of modern connected devices, such as mobile phones, has provided a new digital \r\ndevelopment infrastructure, which may be of significant value to disaster response.\r\nWhen existing surveillance sensors used by a disaster warning and response system cannot \r\nprovide adequate data for situation assessment purposes, crowdsourcing information \r\ncollection can be an effective solution: People armed with wireless devices and social \r\nnetwork services can be used as mobile human sensors. Eye-witness reports from them \r\ncan complement data from in-situ physical sensors and provide the system with more \r\nextensive and detailed sensor coverage.  \r\n\r\nThe crowdsourcing strategy used by the system can be random, relying solely on \r\nmobility of individuals for coverage of the threatened area, or crowd driven, with the \r\nsystem providing situation updates as feedbacks to aid the crowd; or system-driven \r\nwith individuals moving in response to directives from the system. With such a system, \r\nemergency management professionals can also receive most of the information they need \r\nfor preparing themselves to perform a timely and accurate treatment of their patients \r\neven before dispatching a response team to the event.  \r\n\r\nDeveloped By\r\n--------------------\r\n* Arpith K\r\n* Manigandan\r\n* Kumar Vishal\r\n* Vinutha\r\n\r\nProject Guide\r\n-------------\r\n* Mrs Bidisha\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-----------\r\n\r\n    Copyright 2014 \r\n\r\n    Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\n    you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\n    You may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n\r\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n\r\n    Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\n    distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\n    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\n    See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\n    limitations under the License.\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-44764219-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
